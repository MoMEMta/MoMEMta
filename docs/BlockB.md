# Block B description
Note: Block B, also refered as final block (FB), and class in the MadWeight world. Description inspired on the Olivier Mattelaer's PhD [thesis]. 
[thesis]: <https:FIXME>

This block corresponds to an initial state with Bjorken fractions $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$, and a final state with a visible particle with momenta $$p_2$$, and an invisible particule with momenta $$p_1$$, both coming from a resonace with mass $$s_{12}$$. Extra radiation (ISR) it is also allowed.

### Change of variables

From 

$$dq_1 dq_2\frac{d^3 p_1}{(2\pi)^3 2E_1}(2\pi)^4 \delta^4 (P_{in}-P_{fin})$$

to 

$$\frac{1}{4\pi E_1} ds_{12} \times J$$

where J is given by:

$$J = \frac{E_1}{s} |p_{2z} E_1 -  E_2 p_{1z}|^{-1}$$

### Integration flow
Bla

$$(p_1 + p_2)^2 = s_{12}$$
