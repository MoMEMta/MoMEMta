 * Abstraction of the computation graph
 *
 * The computation graph is defined as the list of operation to perform to compute the final weight. Each operations are
 * implemented by modules, symbolized as Vertex in the graph. Connections between modules, symbolized as Edges, as used
 * as constrains to deduce in which orders the operations must be done.
 *
 * If Loopers are present in the configuration, subgraph are also created, one for each looper. These subgraphs are built
 * using the modules present in the execution path of the loopers, in the same way the main graph is built. This means
 * that any modules present in a looper executation path won't be present in the main graph, but will be present in
 * a subgraph. These subgraph are directly managed by the loopers themselves.
